## About AAGU
For detailed information about AAGU, how it formed, and its specific mission, we refer you to our business plan.

## Growth and Funding
AAGU has a plan for funding and growth. But until we have ample funding, we aren't doing much actively. The simple reason is that we want this organization to be by and for autistic (and other ND) people, and we feel reluctant to ask them to volunteer time when they are already underserved.
Our key short-term funding option is our GoFundMe site. We are also applying to grants, scholarships, and other programs.

## Specifics
There are many specific things we are taking action on. Please read about them in our [Resources](?resources) and [Community](?community) pages.
