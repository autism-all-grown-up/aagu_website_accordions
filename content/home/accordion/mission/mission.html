          <p>Because autistic is how you are born, there are actually way more autistic adults than children. Many
            experts believe that massive numbers of adults who have been wondering their entire lives why they have felt
            out
            of place and faced so many challenges in life despite their abilities are probably undiagnosed autistic
            adults. Sadly, experts also think many of these people have ended up on the dark sidelines of society: the
            ranks
            of the unemployed, homeless, in the penal system, in the foster system, struggling with addiction, and lost
            to suicide.</p>

            The Oregon Department of Disability Services (ODDS) reported that the agency was serving 22,984 adults with
            an
            intellectual or developmental disability in 2023. A 2021-2022 survey by ODDS and along with the
            <a href="https://idd.nationalcoreindicators.org/">National Core Indicators</a>] (NCI) project showed that
            6,435 (28%) of Oregon adults receiving I/DD services had an Autism diagnosis. The US Census estimates that
            in 2022 there were roughly 3,404,221 adults (18+) in Oregon. A CDC study (2020) estimated that in 2017,
            2.28% (95% CI [1.83, 2.8]) of Oregon adults are diagnosed as autistic; in numbers: 77,616 (95% CI [62,297,
            95,318]). (Numbers courtesy of Jon Saito, <a href="https://www.orcommissionasd.org">Oregon Council on Autism
