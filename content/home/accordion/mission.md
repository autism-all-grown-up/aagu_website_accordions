## Mission
The mission of Autism All Grown Up (AAGU) is to empower autistic adults in Oregon by serving as a nexus that provides 
accessible information, resources, and services tailored to their unique needs. By bridging gaps in the existing 
infrastructure, we connect and interconnect the adult autistic community and our supporters, facilitate information 
exchange, and promote collaboration. This ensures that autistic individuals can access the support and opportunities 
we need to thrive, enhancing our well-being and independence throughout the state.


## What We Do
- Build community through outreach and autism-friendly physical spaces.
- Identify unmet needs in the community.
- Find ways to meet those needs.

Working from within the community, we listen to autistic voices to identify and document systemic challenges. We then 
perform root cause analysis, create or propose solutions, and publish the results for the public. Our work helps autistic 
adults in Oregon find and access the services and resources they need, helps others better understand their needs, and creates 
new resources as needed.
