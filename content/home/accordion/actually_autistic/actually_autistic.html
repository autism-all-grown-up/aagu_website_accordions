      <p class="summary-text">The autistic community has the talent and ability to create solutions NOW. Actually,
        Autistic adults are not
        what you see on TV.</p>

        <p>Advocacy is working to change our general view of neurodiversity and how we handle it in society,
          including how to adjust research priorities for autism. This work moves slowly. In the meantime, millions of
          autistic adults are trying to redefine and reclaim their identities, and hopefully overcome some of their
          past
          struggles.</p>
        <p>We want to help these people NOW and have found ways to do so without waiting for the slow machinery of
          political, scientific, industrial, and cultural change. Our key insight is that the adult autistic
          community is already primed with untapped resources in the form of talented, creative, and caring people who
          have the exact skills needed.</p>
        <p>Past missteps in identifying and characterizing autism have led to numerous misunderstandings and myths.
          Counter to these, the vast majority of autistic people:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Are cognitively or intellectually capable</li>
          <li>Are socially motivated and want relationships and community</li>
          <li>Are in much greater need of acceptance and understanding vs accommodation</li>
          <li>Are in the best position to support other autistic people, including those who may be profoundly
            impacted by autism, associated trauma, or conditions endemic to autistic genotypes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The growth in leadership by autistic voices in the public arena and academia has firmly established that
          autistics and other neurodivergent people comprise a distinct group rather than merely a broken form of
          normal.</p>
        <p>While we owe a huge debt to the tireless advocacy that parents and other allies have performed over the
          generations, ultimately, no one understands autistic people like other autistic people. Fact.</p>
        <p>AAGU was started by autistic people and we thoroughly enjoy working together. By sourcing talent from
          within the autistic community, we can take one small step towards creating a welcoming environment for other
          autistic people.</p>
