        <p>So little research has acknowledged the lives of adults with autism that we are just starting to learn
          what successful adult development looks like. Until recently, almost all attention to autism has been
          focused
          on children, early intervention, and treatment. Late-identified and never-identified autistic adults face
          unique challenges with respect to aging, and most of these "lost generations" have not yet even been
          identified,
          accounted for, or documented.</p>

        <figcaption>Although the number of "Quality of Life" studies has increased in recent years, it still
          receives a tiny amount of actual funding dollars compared to Biology-oriented studies looking for
          causes, cures, and treatments. The data for this chart comes from the <a
            href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/funding/data/" target="_blank">autism research database</a> provided by the
          <a href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/" target="_blank">Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee</a> (IACC), a
          United States federal advisory panel within the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/" target="_blank">Department of
            Health and Human Services</a> (HHS). It coordinates all efforts within HHS concerning autism spectrum
          disorder (ASD). We bundled the IACC objectives into a smaller number of categories. We put any program with
          an objective related to "Biology", "Causes", "Genetic or Environmental Effects", or "Risk factors" into
          "Biology". We put any
          program with an objective related to "Lifespan", "Lifespan issues", "Services", or "Services and Supports"
          into "Quality of Life".
