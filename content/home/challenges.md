## A Partial List  
- **Work/Life:** Landing and keeping a job is often an uphill battle. Many find themselves unemployed or in roles that 
 don't tap their potential. Hiring processes and workplace environments frequently clash with autistic needs, creating 
 frustrating barriers.
- **Health care hurdles:** Medical settings can be overwhelming sensory minefields. Many doctors struggle to connect with 
 autistic patients, leading to misunderstandings and subpar care. Getting diagnosed as an adult? It's a long, winding road 
 that can delay access to crucial support.
- **Social challenges:** Building and maintaining relationships is like navigating a maze without a map. Isolation is common, 
 especially during significant life transitions like starting a career or living independently. The â€œservices cliffâ€ at high 
 school graduation is a prime example.
- **Mental health struggles:** Anxiety, depression, and thoughts of suicide are all too common. Many mental health services miss 
 the mark, leaving autistic adults feeling misunderstood and unsupported.
- **Learning and working:** Some face learning difficulties that ripple into job prospects. Sensory sensitivities, anxiety, and 
 challenges with independent work can create roadblocks to employment.

These issues often snowball, making life tougher across the board.
