## Guides for Accessing ervices
Information on accessing services for autistic adults is currently scattered and unfocused. Also, most of it is not attuned to the autistic brain that wants plain-spoken facts. Calling offices to get answers runs into communication differences. Finally, autistic adults are tired, which increases the need to have simple, clear, accurate information in a single place.

We started working with HealthShare Oregon to create "explainers" for OHP and paused to focus on launching AAGU. We will complete that project and create explainers for other topics such as:
- Simplest and least expensive routes to a positive evaluation experience. Including how to get the correct referral from the right provider to the right agency.
- The difference between an agency, a PA, and a DSP.
- How to navigate working with I/DD, Vocational Rehab, OHP, SSI, SSDI, and other state agencies.
- Tips for talking to doctors.

These guides will be available on the web, as downloadable PDFs, and in print by request.

## Guides for Medical Professionals
The other project we started with HealthShare Oregon is to create some "explainers" for doctors to help them better understand caring for autistic people. This includes communication, listening, perspective taking, and also the many physical and physiological differences autistic people may have. Regarding OHP, there will be a particular focus on both why and how to write a referral for evaluation. There is such a surprising level of misunderstanding about this in the medical community that we were told by OHSU (in a documented email) that they will no longer do evaluations for autistic adults because "they are not medically necessary".  

## Updated Resources Lists  
There are quite a few Oregon organizations that maintain lists of resources (therapists, doctors, etc.) that serve or are of interest to the adult autistic community. The Autism Society of Oregon has [an excellent one](https://autismsocietyoregon.org/adult-resources/) that gets updated from time to time. We know of none that are able to devote sufficient resources to keep up a complete list that is absolutely accurate and up-to-date. Also, none of them give enough detail about focus, orientation, insurance, payment, and other topics to be complete.

We have been scouring these existing lists and organizing them into our own database that we will provide as dynamic, searchable web application. Our initial goal is to have a staff member funded at 20hrs/week to ensure it is updated.

We will also include ALL support groups, FB groups, activities, Meet-Ups, etc.

## Vetted Scientific Information
Although volumes of what we thought we knew about autism has turned out to be wrong, the scientific community is doing a pretty good job setting it right. But the autism info-verse is growing into an industrial complex of sorts that is full of rumor and speculation. For instance, experts and influencers are putting out articles and videos discussing Asperger's vs. autism, providing advice on how autistic people can overcome their communication deficits, or explaining how some people aren't "as autistic" because "it's a spectrum".

[Embrace Autism](https://embrace-autism.com/) is an amazing website that provides a lot of great information and keeps it updated (articles are tagged as to when they were last updated). We will complement this effort with slightly briefer more academic articles. We feel this is an unfilled niche that will allow professionals (policy makers, doctors, lawyers, teachers, managers, etc.) to find out *what we truly currently know and don't know* regarding autistic adults.

## AAGU Recommendations and Favorites
We will list popular books, websites, podcasts, etc. with information about them and summaries of what people think of them.
