## Guides for Accessing Services
Information on accessing services for autistic adults is currently scattered and unfocused. Also, most of it is not attuned to the autistic brain, which wants plain-spoken facts. Calling offices to get answers runs into communication differences. Finally, autistic adults experience high amounts of burnout and fatigue, which increases the need for simple, straightforward, accurate information in a single place.

We started working with HealthShare Oregon to create "explainers": guides to help OHP members navigate and access services. We paused to focus on launching AAGU. We will complete that project and develop explainers for other topics, such as:
- Simplest and least expensive routes to a positive evaluation experience. Including how to get the correct referral from the right provider to the right agency.
- The difference between an agency, a PA, and a DSP.
- How do you navigate working with I/DD, Vocational Rehab, OHP, SSI, SSDI, and other state and federal agencies?
- Tips for talking to doctors.

These guides will be available as web pages, as downloadable PDFs, and in print by request.

## Guides for Medical Professionals
We are also helping HealthShare Oregon create "explainers" for doctors to help them better understand caring for autistic people on topics such as communication, listening, perspective-taking, and the many physical and physiological differences autistic people may have. Regarding OHP, there will be a particular focus on why and how to write a referral for evaluation. There is such a surprising level of misunderstanding about this in the medical community that we were told by OHSU (in a documented email) that they will no longer do evaluations for autistic adults because "they are not medically necessary".  

## Updated Resources Lists  
Many Oregon organizations maintain lists of resources (therapists, doctors, etc.) that serve or are of interest to the adult autistic community. The Autism Society of Oregon has [an excellent one](https://autismsocietyoregon.org/adult-resources/) that gets consistently updated. We know of none that are able to devote sufficient resources to keep up a complete list that is absolutely accurate and up-to-date. Also, none give enough details about focus, orientation, insurance, payment, and other topics to be entirely thorough.

We have been scouring these existing lists and organizing them into our own database, which we will provide as a searchable web application. Our initial goal is to have a staff member funded at 20 hours/week to ensure it is updated.

We will also include ALL support groups, FB groups, activities, Meet-Ups, etc.

## Vetted Scientific Information
Although volumes of what we thought we knew about autism have turned out to be wrong, the scientific community is doing a pretty good job setting it right. Still, the emerging autism influencer industrial complex creates a steady stream of rumor and speculation that pollutes the autism info-verse. For instance, experts and influencers are putting out articles and videos discussing Asperger's vs. autism, providing advice on how autistic people can overcome their communication deficits, or explaining how some people aren't "as autistic" because "it's a spectrum".

A few of our favorite sources of accurate information are:

* [Embrace autism](https://embrace-autism.com/), which is a fantastic website that provides loads of great information and keeps it updated (articles are tagged as to when they were last updated) written by actually autistic medical and science professionals.
* [Thinking Person's Guide to Autism](https://thinkingautismguide.com/), which features actually autistic writers such as Maxfield Sparrow and Shannon Des Roches Rosa.
* [Divergent Conversations](https://www.divergentpod.com/), which is a podcast by two actually autistic scientists and therapists.

We will complement those with content articles and videos that are less journalistic and editorial, briefer, and slightly more academic. Our articles address questions such as "Is ABA therapy harmful?", "What is autistic burnout?" "Is autism a disability?" "What is neurodiversity?" "Is autism genetic?" "Are autistic people gifted?" etc., by limiting ourselves to the best consensus we can find in current scientific literature. We feel this is an unfilled niche that will allow professionals (policymakers, doctors, lawyers, teachers, managers, etc.) to make more informed decisions about autism and autistic individuals.

Most importantly, these articles will be written by scientifically trained writers and consistently updated.

## AAGU Recommendations and Favorites
We will list popular books, websites, podcasts, etc., with information about them and summaries of what people think about them.
