                        <h2 class="cinnabar">A Partial List</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Work/Life:</strong> Landing and keeping a job is often an uphill battle. Many
                                find themselves unemployed or in roles that
                                don't tap their potential. Hiring processes and workplace environments frequently clash
                                with autistic needs, creating
                                frustrating barriers.</li>
                            <li><strong>Health care hurdles:</strong> Medical settings can be overwhelming sensory
                                minefields. Many doctors struggle to connect with
                                autistic patients, leading to misunderstandings and subpar care. Getting diagnosed as an
                                adult? It's a long, winding road
                                that can delay access to crucial support.</li>
                            <li><strong>Social challenges:</strong> Building and maintaining relationships is like
                                navigating a maze without a map. Isolation is common,
                                especially during big life transitions like starting a career or living independently.
                                The "services cliff" at high
                            school graduation is a prime example.</li>
                            <li><strong>Mental health struggles:</strong> Anxiety, depression, and thoughts of suicide
                                are all too common. Many mental health services miss
                                the mark, leaving autistic adults feeling misunderstood and unsupported.</li>
                            <li><strong>Learning and working:</strong> Some face learning difficulties that ripple into
                                job prospects. Sensory sensitivities, anxiety, and
                                challenges with independent work can create roadblocks to employment.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These issues often snowball, making life tougher across the board.</p>

                                doctors know about autism, all the different ways it affects people's lives, and
                                how to properly talk to and care for autistic people.</p>

                        <p>The mission of Autism All Grown Up (AAGU) is to empower autistic adults in Oregon by serving
                            as a nexus that provides
                            accessible information, resources, and tailored to our unique needs. By bridging gaps in the
                            existing
                            infrastructure, we connect and interconnect the adult autistic community and our supporters,
                            facilitate information
                            exchange, and promote collaboration. This ensures that autistic individuals can access the
                            support and opportunities

                        <p>Working from within the community, we listen to autistic voices to identify and document
                            systemic challenges. We then
                            perform root cause analysis, create or propose solutions, and publish the results for the

                        <p>So little research has acknowledged the lives of adults with autism that we are just starting
                            to learn what successful
                            adult development looks like. Until recently, almost all attention to autism has been
                            focused on children, early
                            intervention, and treatment. Late-identified and never-identified autistic adults face
                            unique challenges with respect
                            to aging, and most of these "lost generations" have not yet even been identified, accounted
                            for, or documented.</p>
                        <h2 class="cinnabar-margin-top">Invisible Majority</h2>
                        <p>Autistic adults represent the vast majority of autistic people but have a tiny fraction of
                            the acknowledgment and
                            support. Because autistic is how we are born, there are, in fact, way more autistic adults
                            than children. Many
                            experts believe that massive numbers of adults who have been wondering their entire lives
                            why they have felt out of
                            place and faced so many challenges in life despite their abilities are probably undiagnosed
                            autistic adults. Sadly,
                            experts also think many of these people have ended up on the dark sidelines of society: the
                            ranks of the unemployed,
                            homeless, in the penal system, in the foster system, struggling with addiction, or lost to
                            suicide.</p>

                            scientific, industrial, and cultural change. Our key insight is that the adult autistic
                            community is already primed with
                            untapped resources in the form of talented, creative, and caring people who have the exact
                            skills needed.</p>
                        <p>Past missteps in identifying and characterizing autism have led to numerous misunderstandings
                            and myths. Counter to these, the
                            vast majority of autistic people:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Are cognitively or intellectually capable</li>
                            <li>Are socially motivated and want relationships and community</li>
                            <li>Are in much greater need of <em>acceptance and understanding</em> than accommodation
                            </li>
                            <li>Are in the best position to support other autistic people, including those who may be
                                profoundly impacted by autism,
                                associated trauma, or conditions endemic to autistic genotypes.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2 class="cinnabar-margin-top">By us and for us</h2>
                        <p>The growth in leadership by autistic voices in the public arena and academia has firmly
                            established that autistics and other
                            neurodivergent people comprise a distinct group rather than merely a broken form of normal.
                        </p>
                        <p>While we owe a huge debt to the tireless advocacy that parents and other allies have
                            performed over the generations, ultimately,
                            no one understands autistic people like other autistic people. Fact.</p>
                        <p>AAGU was started by autistic people and we thoroughly enjoy working together. By sourcing
                            talent from within the autistic community,
                            we can take one small step towards creating a welcoming environment for other autistic
                            people.</p>
