          <h2>Mission</h2>
          <p>The mission of Autism All Grown Up (AAGU) is to empower autistic adults in Oregon by serving as a nexus
            that provides accessible information, resources, and services tailored to their unique needs. By bridging
            gaps in the existing infrastructure, we connect and interconnect the adult autistic community and our
            supporters, facilitate information exchange, and promote collaboration. This ensures that autistic
            individuals can access the support and opportunities we need to thrive, enhancing our well-being and
            independence throughout the state.</p>
          <h2>What We Do</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Build community through outreach and autism-friendly physical spaces.</li>
            <li>Identify unmet needs in the community.</li>
            <li>Find ways to meet those needs.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Working from within the community, we listen to autistic voices to identify and document systemic
            challenges. We then perform root cause analysis, create or propose solutions, and publish the results for
            the public to use. Our work helps autistic adults in Oregon find and access the services and resources they
            need, helps others better understand their needs, and creates new resources as needed.</p>

            The Oregon Department of Disability Services (ODDS) reported that the agency was serving 22,984 adults with an 
            intellectual or developmental disability in 2023. A 2021-2022 survey by ODDS and along with the 
            <a href="https://idd.nationalcoreindicators.org/">National Core Indicators</a> (NCI) project showed that 6,435 (28%) of 
            Oregon adults receiving I/DD services had an Autism diagnosis. The US Census estimates that in 2022 there were roughly 
            3,404,221 adults (18+) in Oregon. A CDC study (2020) estimated that in 2017, 2.28% (95% CI [1.83, 2.8]) of Oregon 
            adults are diagnosed as autistic; in numbers: 77,616 (95% CI [62,297, 95,318]). (Numbers courtesy of Jon Saito,

          <p>So little research has acknowledged the lives of adults with autism that we are just starting to learn
            what
            successful adult development looks like. Until recently, almost all attention to autism has been focused
            on
            children, early intervention, and treatment. Late-identified and never-identified autistic adults face
            unique
            challenges with respect to aging, and most of these “lost generations” have not yet even been identified,
            accounted for, or documented.</p>

              href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/funding/data/" target="_blank">autism research database</a> provided by the
            <a href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/" target="_blank">Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee</a> (IACC), a

            coordinates all efforts within HHS concerning autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We bundled the IACC
            objectives into a smaller number of categories. We put any program with an objective related to
            "Biology", "Causes", "Genetic or Environmental Effects", or "Risk factors" into "Biology". We put any

      <div class="accordion-item-content">
        <div class="accordion-item-text">
          <p>Autistic adults face a multitude of significant and endemic challenges:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Work life:</strong> Landing and keeping a job is often an uphill battle. Many find themselves
              unemployed
              or in roles that don't tap their potential. Hiring processes and workplace environments frequently
              clash
              with autistic needs, creating frustrating barriers.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Health care hurdles:</strong> Medical settings can be overwhelming sensory minefields. Many
              doctors
              struggle to connect with autistic patients, leading to misunderstandings and subpar care. Getting
              diagnosed as
              an adult? It's a long, winding road that can delay access to crucial support.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Social challenges:</strong> Building and maintaining relationships is like navigating a maze
              without a
              map. Isolation is common, especially during big life transitions like starting a career or living
              independently.
              The “services cliff” at high school graduation is a prime example.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Mental health struggles:</strong> Anxiety, depression, and thoughts of suicide are all too common.
              Many
              mental health services miss the mark, leaving autistic adults feeling misunderstood and unsupported.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Learning and working:</strong> Some face learning difficulties that ripple into job prospects.
              Sensory
              sensitivities, anxiety, and challenges with independent work can create roadblocks to employment.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            These issues often snowball, making life tougher across the board. AAGU believes it can help nurture organic
            changes
            by facilitating small steps to empower autistic adults to live rich, independent lives:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Create autism-friendly workspaces </li>
            <li>Train healthcare providers to really get it </li>
            <li>Build stronger social support networks </li>
            <li>Develop mental health approaches that actually click with autistic minds </li>
            <li>Tailor work and education to play to autistic strengths</li>
          </ul>

          <p>and do this by supporting existing programs through networking, collaboration, and education.</p>

          <p>Advocacy is working to change our general view of neurodiversity and how we handle it in society,
            including
            how to adjust research priorities for autism. This work moves slowly. In the meantime, millions of
            autistic
            adults are trying to redefine and reclaim their identities, and hopefully overcome some of their past
            struggles.</p>

          <p>We want to help these people NOW and have found ways to do so without waiting for the slow machinery of
            political, scientific, industrial, and cultural change. Our key insight is that the adult autistic
            community
            is already primed with untapped resources in the form of talented, creative, and caring people who have
            the
            exact skills needed.</p>

          <p>Past missteps in identifying and characterizing autism have led to numerous misunderstandings and myths.
            Counter to these, the vast majority of autistic people:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Are cognitively or intellectually capable</li>
            <li>Are socially motivated and want relationships and community</li>
            <li>Are in much greater need of acceptance and understanding vs accommodation</li>
            <li>Are in the best position to support other autistic people, including those who may be profoundly
              impacted
              by autism, associated trauma, or conditions endemic to autistic genotypes.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The growth in leadership by autistic voices in the public arena and academia has firmly established that
            autistics and other neurodivergent people comprise a distinct group rather than merely a broken form of
            normal.</p>

          <p>While we owe a huge debt to the tireless advocacy that parents and other allies have performed over the
            generations, ultimately, no one understands autistic people like other autistic people. Fact.</p>

          <p>AAGU was started by autistic people and we thoroughly enjoy working together. By sourcing talent from
            within
            the autistic community, we can take one small step towards creating a welcoming environment for other
            autistic
            people.</p>
