  <h1>Autism All Grown Up</h1>
  <p>Autism is all grown up now, and it isn’t always pretty. The phrase “All Grown Up” captures the bittersweet
    realization that often occurs when one encounters an individual they knew as a child, only to find that their
    preconceived notions no longer fit the adult standing before them.</p>

        Autistic adults represent the vast majority of autistic people but have a tiny fraction of the acknowledgment
        and support they need.

          <p>Because autistic is how you are born, there are actually way more autistic adults than children. Many
            experts
            believe that massive numbers of adults who have been wondering their entire lives why they have felt out of
            place and faced so many challenges in life despite their abilities are probably undiagnosed autistic adults.
            Sadly, experts also think many of these people have ended up on the dark sidelines of society: the ranks of
            the unemployed, homeless, in the penal system, in the foster system, struggling with addiction, and lost to
            suicide.</p>

          <p>So little research has acknowledged the lives of adults with autism that we are just starting to learn what
            successful adult development looks like. Until recently, almost all attention to autism has been focused on
            children, early intervention, and treatment. Late-identified and never-identified autistic adults face
            unique
            challenges with respect to aging, and most of these “lost generations” have not yet even been identified,
            accounted for, or documented.</p>

        The autistic community has the talent and ability to create solutions NOW. Actually, Autistic adults are not
        what you see on TV.

          <p>Advocacy is working to change our general view of neurodiversity and how we handle it in society, including
            how to adjust research priorities for autism. This work moves slowly. In the meantime, millions of autistic
            adults are trying to redefine and reclaim their identities, and hopefully overcome some of their past
            struggles.</p>

          <p>We want to help these people NOW and have found ways to do so without waiting for the slow machinery of
            political, scientific, industrial, and cultural change. Our key insight is that the adult autistic community
            is already primed with untapped resources in the form of talented, creative, and caring people who have the
            exact skills needed.</p>

          <p>Past missteps in identifying and characterizing autism have led to numerous misunderstandings and myths.
            Counter to these, the vast majority of autistic people:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Are cognitively or intellectually capable</li>
            <li>Are socially motivated and want relationships and community</li>
            <li>Are in much greater need of acceptance and understanding vs accommodation</li>
            <li>Are in the best position to support other autistic people, including those who may be profoundly
              impacted
              by autism, associated trauma, or conditions endemic to autistic genotypes.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The growth in leadership by autistic voices in the public arena and academia has firmly established that
            autistics and other neurodivergent people comprise a distinct group rather than merely a broken form of
            normal.</p>

          <p>While we owe a huge debt to the tireless advocacy that parents and other allies have performed over the
            generations, ultimately, no one understands autistic people like other autistic people. Fact.</p>

          <p>AAGU was started by autistic people and we thoroughly enjoy working together. By sourcing talent from
            within
            the autistic community, we can take one small step towards creating a welcoming environment for other
            autistic
            people.</p>
