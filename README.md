The detail "summaries" have actual summaries so are more than just headings. One could just read them and get a sense of the website. 
Opening the summaries provides additional information.

This enables the website for fully explain a number of things while maintaining a minimal amount of information on the screen
at any one time.

Later will add a feature to close open details when a new one is opened.
