<p>Autistic adults face a multitude of significant and endemic challenges:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Work life:</strong> Landing and keeping a job is often an uphill battle. Many find themselves unemployed
        or in roles that don&#39;t tap their potential. Hiring processes and workplace environments frequently clash
        with autistic needs, creating frustrating barriers.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Health care hurdles:</strong> Medical settings can be overwhelming sensory minefields. Many doctors
        struggle to connect with autistic patients, leading to misunderstandings and subpar care. Getting diagnosed as
        an adult? It&#39;s a long, winding road that can delay access to crucial support. 
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Social challenges:</strong> Building and maintaining relationships is like navigating a maze without a
        map. Isolation is common, especially during big life transitions like starting a career or living independently.
        The “services cliff” at high school graduation is a prime example. 
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Mental health struggles:</strong> Anxiety, depression, and thoughts of suicide are all too common. Many
        mental health services miss the mark, leaving autistic adults feeling misunderstood and unsupported. 
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Learning and working:</strong> Some face learning difficulties that ripple into job prospects. Sensory
        sensitivities, anxiety, and challenges with independent work can create roadblocks to employment.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    These issues often snowball, making life tougher across the board. AAGU believes it can help nurture organic changes
    by facilitating small steps to empower autistic adults to live rich, independent lives:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Create autism-friendly workspaces </li>
    <li>Train healthcare providers to really get it </li>
    <li>Build stronger social support networks </li>
    <li>Develop mental health approaches that actually click with autistic minds </li>
    <li>Tailor work and education to play to autistic strengths</li>
</ul>

<p>and do this by supporting existing programs through networking, collaboration, and education.</p>
